// Additionally open the 'Embrace-Info.plist' file and fill in your own API_KEY
// Make sure to look at the 'Embrace Symbol Upload' build phase to learn about dsyms and symbolication

        //
        // Note: If you want to also use other reporting system such as Crashlytics, that's ok!  Just make sure to initialize Embrace
        // first so we can ensure our compatibility with Crashlytics.  Also set 'CRASH_REPORT_ENABLED' to 'NO' in Embrace-Info.plist if

        // application runs on kiosk hardware in retail stores, you could add the store id as a permanent property.  Now you can filter and
        // search based on your deployed locations.

        // real hardware, without Xcode running, to ensure the crash is captured correctly.
