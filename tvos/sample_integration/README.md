# Embrace tvOS sample application

This sample project demonstrates many of the features of Embrace so you can better understand how to use them within your own application.

The application is based off the Apple template master-detail application, which ships with Xcode.  

As you read through the code, look out for "Embrace Hint" comments.  These explain why we're making the calls were making, and may give you some ideas of how to use Embrace yourself.

## Instructions for running
Embrace is integrated with this project using cocoa pods.  Make sure you run "pod update" from the root folder to get the latest version.

To try this sample against your own integration, first sign up for an Embrace API key here: https://dash.embrace.io

This project contains an Embrace-Info.plist.  Open that file and replace "USE_YOUR_KEY" with your real key.
